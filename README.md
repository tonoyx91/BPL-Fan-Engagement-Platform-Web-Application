#Frontend only

I alongside with my dedicated teammates Major Nofaer vai, Sejuty Das and Shumin Nahar Esha have developed a web application "BPL Fan Engagement Platform" for our SDP(Software Development Project) course. Heartfelt appreciation for their unwavering hard work and dedication throughout the whole project.
Technologies used: React JS, Node, Express

As a sports lover, this project is so much special for me.
